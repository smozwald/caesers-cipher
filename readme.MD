# Caesers Cypher in Django

This project, completed for the Odin Project (originally intended to be a ruby on rails project), aims to implement a simple frontend for the Caesers Cipher problem.

## Current TO-DO
- Make the app start running, just get some basic responses.
- Create a form on website, when user enters something they have the string reprinted.
- Create another form which allows an integer to be input. A filter will be applied to input string based on the number chosen (e.g. both will be passed to a cipher function).
